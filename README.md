This tool was created using only HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

This project is part of The __Odin Project's curriculum__ to become a Full Stack Developer!

The style is pretty basic but functional, I aimed to make it look clean.

## Stack & Tools

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub + Mac Terminal
- ESLint + npm to manage the project, and enforce JS syntax and style

## What I learned

* Improved **Javascript** fundamentals: 
  - Digged deepeer into HTML5collections, nodelists, arrays.
  - Deepened knoweledge about Event listeners and how to nest them (and reset them).
  - Used string manipulation to darken incrementally the color of cells when hovering: a lot of meditation for that!!
  - Learned how cleaner and simpler are Event delegations instead of looping (tho, it wasn't usable in my project)
  - Improved by ability to look into documentation and search with on spot questions (and answers)
* Mastered configuration of ESLint + Prettier (the latter, I chose not to use in the end).
* Started using npm to initialize project.
* Deepened __Git__ knowledge about revert, reset, stash, working directory, and __VScode__ interface about them: very useful in times of debugging. :smile:

## What could be improved

* I wish to improve my knowledge in responsiveness and correct usage of length units to achieve that (vw, rem, em)
